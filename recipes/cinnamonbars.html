    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 
            11x7-inch baking dish.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine flour, sweetener, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda, 
            and salt in a large bowl; mix until well combined.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk together egg, oil, applesauce, and honey in a second bowl 
            until well combined. Stir into the dry ingredients. Fold in nuts. 
            Transfer batter into the prepared baking dish and smooth out the 
            surface.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the 
            center comes out clean, 18 to 22 minutes. Remove from oven and 
            allow to cool.
        </li>
        <li>
            For the icing, combine powdered sugar substitute, butter, honey, 
            almond milk, vanilla, and cinnamon in a bowl. Spread or drizzle 
            icing onto the cooled bars.
        </li>
