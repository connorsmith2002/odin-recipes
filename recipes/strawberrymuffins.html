        </li>
        <li>
            Beat 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a mixing bowl using 
            an electric mixer until creamy. Add egg and mix well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Sift flour, baking powder, and salt together in a small bowl. 
            Add flour mixture and milk alternately to butter mixture until 
            combined. Stir in vanilla extract. Gently stir in strawberries.
        </li>
