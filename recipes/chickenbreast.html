    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Since food for air travel needs to be prepared far in advance, 
        airlines back in the day created a special cut of chicken breast 
        that wouldn't dry out as much as normal.
    </p>

    <p>
        This chicken is a great cut of meat that is only 1122 calories and 93.8 grams
        of protein per serving. Overall, a delicious and nutritious option!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 whole chicken</li>
        <li>1 drizzle olive oil</li>
        <li>kosher salt to taste</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 pinches herbes de Provence</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 sprig fresh rosemary</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>
        <li>1/2 cup chicken stock, or to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Slice off 1/2 of each chicken wing by cutting through 
            the joint where the wing meets the drumette. Slice through the 
            skin between the thighs and breasts. Make a shallow cut along 
            the breast bone and 2 deep cuts on either side, separating 
            the breasts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Slice each breast off the carcass using the tip of the knife,
            keeping the blade pressed against the bone. Cut through the
            cartilage to remove breast with the wing attached.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the tenders and trim as needed. Season with a drizzle of
            olive oil, salt, pepper, herbes de Provence, and cayenne pepper.
        </li>
        <li>
            Push your finger gently under the skin of each breast, right
            next to the wing bone, to separate it from the meat. Slide 1 
            tender under the skin, center it, and smooth over the skin. 
            Sprinkle salt over breasts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat.
            Add chicken breasts, skin-side down. Cook until bottom is 
            browned, 6 to 7 minutes. Flip, reduce heat to medium, and cook
            until no longer pink on the inside, 7 to 10 minutes more.
            Add 1 tablespoon butter, rosemary, and thyme. Baste chicken
            with the butter. Remove chicken from the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>
            Pour stock into the pan; increase heat to high. Boil until
            reduced to desired thickness, about 2 minutes. Turn off heat 
            and whisk in remaining butter. Slice each chicken breast into 
            thirds and spoon the pan sauce on top.
